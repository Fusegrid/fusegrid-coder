h1. Fusegrid Coder

Fusegrid Coder an experiment to leverage the power of Vim to create the ultimate ColdFusion Development Environment through a preset .Vim configuration and plugin bundle.

h2. Preperation

To use Fusegrid Coder for CFML development you'll need to install Vim. While there are many different ways to get vim, here is what works for us:

* Unix: "vim-7.2.tar.bz2":ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/unix/vim-7.2.tar.bz2 
** For Debian based distros install with apt-get (ubuntu desktop: sudo apt-get install vim-gnome)
* Windows: "gvim72.x.exe":http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=43866&package_id=39721.
* OS-X: "MacVim-7_2-stable-1_2":http://macvim.googlecode.com/files/MacVim-7_2-stable-1_2.tbz.
** If you want the latest and greatest try the "Snapshot":http://code.google.com/p/macvim/wiki/Snapshot

h2. Fusegrid Coder dotVim

Clone this repo into your home directory either as .vim (Linux) or vimfiles (Windows).

Put this in your vimrc along with your personal hacks:
<pre><code>
source ~/.vim/vimrc      "linux

</code></pre>

h2. Usage

Once the project proves to provide a stable development enviroment, I'll post some docs.
